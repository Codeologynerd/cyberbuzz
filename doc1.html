			A lockdown is a prison protocol that usually prevents people, information or cargo from leaving an area. The protocol <br>
			can usually only be initiated by someone in a position of authority. Lockdowns can also be used to protect people inside<br>
			 a facility or, for example, a computing system, from a threat or other external event. Of buildings, a drill lockdown <br>
			 usually means that doors leading outside are locked such that no person may enter or exit. A full lockdown usually means<br>
			  that people must stay where they are and may not enter or exit a building or rooms within said building. If people are <br>
			  in a hallway, they should go to the nearest safe, enclosed room.

Emergency Lockdown
	</font>
	<br>	<br>
	<p>
	Emergency lockdowns are implemented when there is imminent threat to the lives or risk of injury to humans, for example, a school's <br>
emergency lockdown procedures must be kept short and simple to make them easier to use under real life crisis conditions. Simple procedures<br>
 can be easily taught with periodic lockdown drills instead of lengthy training.</p>

		A preventive lockdown is a preemptive action plan implemented to address an unusual scenario or a weakness in system to preemp<br>

					Lockdown procedures vary by school district. Generally, a lockdown means that interior and exterior doors are locked, and<br>
					 all students and staff must remain in their location from the time the lockdown is announced. Windows are covered, and<br>

					Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, lockdown procedures in schools have been constantly changing. Some schools direct <br>

			In its most common usage in corrections units, the term lockdown can be defined as a course of action to control the movement of<br>
			 inmates. Confining all prisoners, except workers, to their cells until the end of the day is an example of a "lockdown period" in<br>
			  a corrections schedule. However a "full lockdown" is used when all prisoners are locked in their cells to prevent prison riots <br>
			  or unrest from spreading or during an emergency.

Make sure to have a 30-day supply of any medications you may need, says New Jersey board certified anesthesiologist Dr. Nina Radcliff, adding <br>
that a 90-day supply “would be even better.”<br><br>
Connecticut-based paramedic Liz Connolly advised having a fever reducing medication like Tylenol in the medicine cabinet, to treat the fever<br>

		In most places tap water is safe to drink, but for people living in areas where the tap water is not potable, it is best to stock up <br>

<br>
		Connolly also recommends buying thirst quenching drinks such as Gatorade or Pedialyte, to help with dehydration in the event you do<br>

The World Health Organization has reported that common symptoms of the virus include fever, tiredness, and dry cough, while other <br>
symptoms include nausea and diarrhea.<br>
<br>
“We are seeing an uptick of COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, so having foods in your pantry like plain crackers,<br>
 applesauce, soup, and rice are recommended,” said Connolly.

						Life before COVId-19 was busy ad eventful. A lot of us had little time to catch up long-lost friends. We often wonder<br>
				 whatever happened to that girl who used to share tiffin with us during recess in the fifth standard. Or what’s up with<br>

<br><br>
				   A heart to heart with an old school friend, reliving your childhood, will not only make you feel good but also bring<br>

		This is one of the ways to not let the lockdown get to your head. You can go for different kinds of workouts which can be done indoors like<br>
		 yoga, cardio, treadmill, etc. There are so many indoor exercise videos available online that you can practice at home. Exercise helps you <br>
