Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will <br>experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. < Older people, and those with underlying <br>medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
<br><br>
The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect<br> yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 <br>virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you<br> also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br>
<br>
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential <br>treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</span>

						A novel coronavirus outbreak was first documented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December2019. As of this writing, it <br>has now been confirmed on six continents and in more than 100 countries. As the world’s health systems funnel resources<br> into learning about, treating, and preventing infections in humans, new information is released daily.<br><br>
						 In this two-part article series, we will first provide some history on coronaviruses to put this disease outbreak in <br>perspective, and discuss global health security and planning for pandemic response. Secondly, we will offer guidance from<br> the best trusted sources for prevention and planning in the workplace and at home.

Two other recent coronavirus outbreaks have been experienced. <b><i>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)</i></b> of 2012 was found<br>
to transmit from dromedary camels to humans. In 2002, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) was found to transmit from <br>
civet catsto humans.<span id="dot">...</span><span id="big">
<br><br><br>
<br>
Although COVID-19 has already shown some similarities to recent coronavirus outbreaks, there are differences and we will learn much <br>
more aswe deal with this one. SARS cases totaled 8,098 with a fatality rate of 11 percent as reported in 17 countries, with the<br>
 majority of cases occurring in southern mainland China and Hong Kong. The fatality rate was highly dependent on the age of the<br>
  patient with those under 24 least likely to die (one percent) and those over 65 most likely to die (55 percent). <br>
<br>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2020, MERS cases total more than 2,500, have been reported in 21 countries,<br>
 and resulted in about 860 deaths.3 The fatality rate may be much lower as those with mild symptoms are most likely undiagnosed.<br>
  Only two cases have been confirmed in the United States, both in May of 2014 and both patients had recently traveled to Saudi<br>
   Arabia. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula.

<p>
	Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local<br>
	 public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. <br>
	 Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks.<span id="dot1">...</span><span id="large"> However, the situation is unpredictable<br>
	  so check regularly for the latest news.<br><br>
	To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer<br>
	 or wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully.
	 <br>
	 Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach. Teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use.<br>
Apply a coin-sized amount on your hands. There is no need to use a large amount of the product.Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose<br>
 immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as it can cause irritation.<br>
 <br><br>
Hand sanitizers recommended to protect against COVID-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable. Do not <br>
use before handling fire or cooking. Under no circumstance, drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand <br>
sanitizer. It can be poisonous. Remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19.
